        <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
